Why in News?

Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)

have once again come into focus for its role in

mobilising communities, protecting rights, and filling gaps in governance.

Beyond the state and markets, it drives collective action, ensures citizen participation, and strengthens democracy in India.

What is a Civil Society Organization?

About:

CSO society refers to

non-state, non-profit entities

that unite people voluntarily to work collectively toward shared social, cultural, or ethical goals.

Evolution of CSOs in India:

Ancient–Medieval Roots:

Civil society in India has deep roots in the ideas of

dharma (duty), daan (giving), and karma,

which encouraged service to others through religious and social movements.

Pre-Independence Era:

Reformers challenged

caste discrimination, untouchability, and other social evils

, linking voluntary action to social reform.

Brahmo Samaj (1828)

(promoted social and religious reform),

Theosophical Society (1879)

(spread spiritual and educational reform), and

Ramakrishna Mission

(1897)

(emphasized service to humanity).

Efforts were often

unorganized and relief-based

, but they laid a moral foundation for later mobilization.

Gandhi’s philosophy of

self-reliance, upliftment of the poor, and constructive work

inspired mass participation and voluntary service organizations.

Post-Independence:

The new Indian state expanded welfare but recognized the

supporting role of voluntary organizations

.

First Five-Year Plan (1951–56)

emphasized cooperation between government and NGOs.

Decentralization through the

three-tier

Panchayati Raj system

gave space for cooperatives, farmer unions, and local associations to flourish.

During the 1965–67 droughts, many

international NGOs entered India with foreign aid

and later set up permanent offices, reshaping civil society funding.

Contemporary Era:

Civil society shifted from welfare delivery to a

rights- and empowerment-based approach

seen in movements like

Chipko (1973)

and

Narmada Bachao

(1985).

Civil society broadened its agenda to include

rights to food, work (MGNREGA), education (RTE Act), health, and information (RTI Act)

.

CSOs recognized as development partners of the state.NGOs expanded into

gender, caste, environment, and marginalized issues

, becoming key watchdogs of democracy.

India with around  3.3 million NGOs Today, India has around

1.5 million NGOs

involving

over 19 million volunteers and staff

, though most remain small and volunteer-driven.

Regulatory Framework for Civil Society in India

Societies

: Societies Registration Act, 1860; for literary, scientific, and charitable purposes.

Trusts

: Indian Trusts Act, 1882; states also have Public Trust Acts (e.g., Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950).

Companies

: Section 8 of Indian Companies Act, 2013; for not-for-profit activities like education, social welfare, environment, etc.

Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), 2010:

Applies to all CSOs receiving foreign contributions.

What is the Role of Civil Society in a  Democracy?

Ensuring Accountability:

CSOs act as a watchdog, scrutinizing state actions and checking political abuses and corruption.

The Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, Rajasthan, was instrumental in the passage of the national Right to Information (RTI) Act of 2005.

CSOs play a crucial role in monitoring elections, detecting fraud, and affirming legitimacy.

Empowering Citizens and Promoting Democratic Norms:

Educates citizens about

laws, rights, and governance

, sustaining an informed citizenry.

Fosters

tolerance, respect for dissent, and compromise

, promoting democratic social norms.

Provides platforms for

marginalized groups

(women, poor, persons with disabilities) to participate in governance, as seen in the role of CSOs advocating for the

Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.

Women Empowerment:

Organizations like

Jagori and Swayam

have raised awareness about women’s rights and promoted political participation.

The Institute of Social Sciences' "Women’s Political Empowerment Program" has trained over 15,000 women for leadership roles in Panchayati Raj Institutions.

PRIDE India

has supported advocacy for women's rights through research and data collection.

SEWA (Self-Employed Women’s Association)
