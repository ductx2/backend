  "summary": "ISRO successfully launched Aditya‑L1, India's first dedicated solar observatory, to study the Sun's corona and solar wind from the Lagrangian point L1. The mission enhances India's space research portfolio and contributes to better understanding of space weather, which has implications for communication, navigation, and power systems."
